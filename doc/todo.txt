1. Priorities                                                 *todo-priorities*

Priorities exist between 1-3, where 1 is the most important and 3 is the least
important. There are also two non ranking priorities, unknown(!) and done(x).
When sorting, unknown will always move to the top and done to the bottom.

Each main todo with major priority must be separated from others by newlines.
Any lines beneath the major priority line can be prioritized, but will not be
sorted.
